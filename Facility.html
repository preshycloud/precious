        Our facility offers frequent independent physician observation and care, as well as the focused services of an interdisciplinary team. Primefort Hospital Center strives to provide patients with an optimal level of care based on their physician's orders. The goal is always to help our patients improve and move to the next level of care - whether thatâ€™s skilled nursing care, home health services or a return to home without further services.
